# Map
Presented up front is the __*final*__ mapping product on which the rest of this document is based.The map shows the ORMGP jurisdiction discretized into sub-watersheds each approximately ~10km² in area. Using the mouse to click on any sub-watershed will return a number of properties of the selected sub-watershed. In the interactive map below, sub-watersheds are colour-coded according to their percentage of impervious cover.  The menu in the top-right corner provides similar options for canopy coverage, weltland coverage, open water coverage and permeability.

# Introduction

The ORMGP jurisdiction, which covers over three-million hectares, has been divided into sub-watersheds, each of which is approximately 10 km² in area. These sub-watersheds provide a basis for hydrometeorological data analysis. Each sub-watershed has a defined topological order in which headwater sub-watersheds can easily be mapped to subsequent downstream sub-watersheds, and so on until feeding one of Lake Huron, Lake Ontario or Lake Simcoe. The intent is that these sub-watersheds are suitable for climatological and water budget analyses. Below is a description of the derivation the v.2020 OWRC 10km² sub-watershed map and its derivatives including:

- a catchment area delineation tool
- an interpolated real-time daily meteorological dataset dating back to the year 1900
- an overlay analysis performed to characterize sub-watershed:
 + impervious area
 + canopy coverage
 + water body coverage
 + wetland coverage
 + permeability
 + mean slope and dominant aspect
 + mean depth to water table.

The development of this interactive map includes the processing of a provincial Digital Elevation Model (DEM) yielding a "hydrologically-correct" model of the ORMGP ground surface. From this information, the ORMGP region is portioned into 2,813 ~10km² sub-watersheds. Next, the hydrologically-corrected digital elevation model (HDEM) is further processed to derive a number of metrics aggregated at the sub-watershed scale. These steps are described below.

# Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
Ground surface elevations were collected from the 2006 version of the provincial (Ministry of Natural Resources) DEM. This is a DEM with 10 m x 10 m cells and is derived from 1:10,000 scale Ontario Base Map (OBM) mapping based on photogrammetic elevation points and 5 m contours where the photogrammetic elevation points did not exist. An up-scaled  Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with 50 m by 50 m cells was produced by merging the tiles shown below:

```{r fig.asp=0.50, fig.align="center", fig.width=12, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="MNR 2006 Provincial DEM tiles shown in green."}
library(ggplot2)
library(geojsonio)
library(sf)

spGL <- geojson_read("shp/greatLakes.geojson",  what="sp")
spMNR <- geojson_read("shp/MNR_2006-tiles.geojson",  what="sp")
spORMGP <- geojson_read("shp/ORMGP-region.geojson",  what="sp")
spYPDTH <- geojson_read("shp/YPDTH.geojson",  what="sp")

spMNR_points <- as.data.frame(do.call(rbind, lapply(spMNR@polygons, function(x) x@labpt))) # Convert nested list to data frame by column
names(spMNR_points) <- c('long','lat') 
spMNR_points$num = spMNR$NUMBER

ggplot() +
    geom_polygon(data=spGL, aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group), fill="#51a8ff", color="#51a8ff") +
    geom_polygon(data=spYPDTH, aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group), fill=NA, color="brown", size=1) +
    geom_polygon(data=spORMGP, aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group), fill=NA, color="orange4", size=1) +
    geom_polygon(data=spMNR, aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group), fill=NA, color="darkgreen",size=1) +
    
    geom_text(data=spMNR_points, aes(x=long, y=lat, label=num), color="darkgreen") +
    
    theme_bw() + theme(axis.title = element_blank(), 
                       title = element_blank(), 
                       legend.box.spacing = unit(0, "mm")) +
                       # plot.background=element_rect(fill="red")) +
    #labs(x='longitude',y='latitude', title="MNR 2006 Provincial DEM tiles shown in green.") +
    coord_sf(xlim=c(-81, -77), ylim=c(43, 45.75), expand=FALSE)
```

Elevation data were up-scaled by taking the average of known elevations occurring within each 50 m by 50 m cell. The resulting grid includes 5000 by 5000 uniform cells, with an upper-left-corner origin at (E: 545,000, N: 5,035,000) NAD83 UTM zone 17.

## Hydrological Correction {#hyd.corr}

An automated topological analysis was performed on the DEM using the following methodologies:

1. Automated depression filling (Wang and Liu, 2006) was applied to the DEM. This filtering of elevation data ensures that every grid cell has at least 1 neighbouring cell with an assigned elevation at or below the current cell's elevation. This ensures that "drainage" is never impeded.
2. While the above code works for most of the area, it will leave flat (zero-gradient) regions especially around lakes and wetlands. A fix by Garbrecht and Martz (1997) was added to ensure a consistent flow direction with negligible change to the corrected DEM.
3. Flow paths are then computed based on the "D8" algorithm (O'Callaghan and Mark, 1984).

Cell slopes and aspects are computed using a 9-point planar regression from the cell's elevation plus it's 8 neighbouring elevations.

## Manual adjustments

While the automated hydrological corrections described above are powerful when applied to the Provincial DEM, there are in rare places where the algorithm fails to capture mapped flow paths (usually in flatter rural regions close to embanked roads). Fortunately, these errors can be easily corrected by imposing flow directions using hand-drawn flow paths,which are saved as polylines, which have vertices ordered according to flow direction. 

With the current version (v.2020), 10 flow corrections have been imposed and are saved in a set of shapefiles.  There is currently one new flow path correction in queue and will be imposed for the next release. *This is to say that this layer and its derivatives are continually being updated.*

\
The benefit of computing the flow direction topology associated with the HDEM is that a user could place a virtual water particle on the landscape and follow its drainage path as it traverses toward its terminus; in this case, the Great Lakes.

More importantly, with this HDEM, a user can also estimate the contributing area to any selected point on the landscape. (A live demonstration of this [is presented below](#cat.delin).) This feature provides the means to validate the process in this document.

Locations of 96 current and historical stream flow gauges are used to compare drainage areas reported to the drainage areas computed using the HDEM. Sources of the station locations were collected from the Water Survey of Canada (WSC) and the Toronto Region Conservation Authority (TRCA). The table below lists the stations used in this validation process, and is followed by a figure that shows a comparison of their match to the HDEM. As mentioned earlier, this layer will be routinely updated with input from users.

# Derivative products

An overlay analysis is the process of overlaying to or more spatial layers and capturing statistics associated with their relative coverage. In this case, the sub-watershed layer is overlain by Provincial land-use and surficial geology layers to obtain information like percent impervious, relative permeability, etc.

The Provincial layers are discussed in more detail below and have all been re-sampled to the grid associated with the [hydrologically corrected DEM](#hyd.corr), with 50 m by 50 m cell sizes. It is from these rasters where the aggregation of watershed characteristics is computed.

## Land use

The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (2019) SOLRIS version 3.0 provincial land-use layer is used to aggregate imperviousness and canopy coverage at the sub-watershed scale. In areas to the north, where the SOLRIS coverage discontinues, interpretation was applied by: 

1. Using Provincial mapping of roads, wetlands and water bodies, areas outside of the SOLRIS data bounds *(typically up on the Canadian Shield)* are filled in with the appropriate SOLRIS land-use class index (201, 150, 170, respectively--MNRF, 2019); and,
2. All remaining area not covered by SOLRIS is assumed Forest (SOLRIS land use class index of 90), as observed with satellite imagery.

The dominant SOLRIS land use class (by area) is assigned the Land use class index for every 50 m x 50 m grid cell.

</center>
\

### Land use coverage

For each ~10km² sub-watershed and given a grid with 50 m by 50 m cell sizes, there should be a set of approximately 4,000 SOLRIS land-use class indices. Using a look-up system, the set of cells contained within a sub-watershed is assigned a value of imperviousness, water body, wetland and canopy coverage (according to their SOLRIS index) and accumulated to a sub-watershed sum.

## Surficial geology

The Ontario Geological Survey's 2010 Surficial Geology of southern Ontario layer (OGS, 2010) also assigns a grid with 50 m by 50 m cell sizes by the dominant class.

\

### Permeability

The OGS classes have been grouped according to the attribute permeability using a similar look-up table cross-referencing scheme. OGS (2010) adds: *"Permeability classification is a very generalized one, based purely on characteristics of material types."* 

After assigning an assumed effective hydraulic conductivity (K) to every permeability group, sub-watershed permeability is then calculated as the geometric mean of 50 m x 50 m grid cells contained within a sub-watershed. The Effective hydraulic conductivity value assumed for every group is shown here:

<br></br>
<center>Permeability classifications (after OGS, 2010) and assumed effective hydraulic conductivities.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(dplyr)
par <- c("Low","Low-medium","Medium","Medium-high","high","unknown/variable","fluvial","organics")
val <- format(c(1e-9,1e-8,1e-7,1e-6,1e-5,1e-8,1e-5,1e-6),digits=3)
data.frame(par,val) %>%
  kbl(
    col.names = c(" ", "K (m/s)"),
    align = c("l","r")
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
```
</center>

The resulting effective hydraulic conductivity is then reverted back to the nearest Low--High OGS (2010) classification.

## Contributing area delineation {#cat.delin}

One of the many APIs (application programming interfaces) hosted by the ORMGP leverages the computed drainage topology. Users have the ability to delineate catchment area polygon for any given point that lies within the HDEM extent. Try below:

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.height='600px', out.width='100%', fig.cap="ORMGP v.2020 HDEM. Click anywhere (within our jurisdiction) to return its contributing area. *Hint: best to click along a watercourse*"}
knitr::include_app("https://owrc.shinyapps.io/CAdemo/", height = "600px")
```
